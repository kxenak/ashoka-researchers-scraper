Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at Ashoka University (India). I am preparing for my next step, and hope to be able to work with a smart, mutually respected group of people. Her Research Interests: I specialize in experimental psychology, with an emphasis in social cognition. As a psychologist, I am interested in human interactions in general. To be a bit more specific, my general research interests include—but are not limited to—emotion, morality, belief, social perception, intergroup bias, and double standards. Like the saying goes, research is me-search. Inevitably, throughout my life, I learned that culture is a crucial element that defines who a person is. Since cultures differ greatly, people with different cultural backgrounds may have different cognitions, feelings, and understandings of the same things. Thus, I often investigate the above topics cross-culturally. Throughout my experience, I learned that this process has to be navigated carefully, as it is not simply a matter of comparing two or more cultures and making a claim that there are different narratives. Lastly, as is the nature of psychology, I believe in an interdisciplinary approach to the topics; I investigate things cognitively, neurologically and physiologically. I also use different methods to increase validity and reliability, and I value replications.

Professor Roy is currently working on a book project called Of Grass And Gardens, Roots And Forests, And Magical Plants: Five Plant Thinkers Of Twentieth Century Bengal (Oxford University Press, forthcoming), which looks at the work of five South Asians: Rabindranath Tagore, Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay, Jibanananda Das, Shakti Chattopadhyay, and Satyajit Ray. These poets, writers, artists and filmmakers, artists who were neither botanists nor environmentalists, she argues, wrote what could be called ‘plant philosophy’. Each of these writers, who were neither botanists nor environmentalists, display a tendency to return to a favoured form of discourse around plant life – Tagore on the garden, Bandyopadhyay on the forest, Das on grass, Chattopadhyay on roots and leaves, and Ray on fantastical plants. This book is an attempt to study their work against the background of the new consciousness about plant life created by scientific research, art, and evolving socio-religious practices of the time. </p>', '', '<p>Conjeeveram Srirangachari Rajan is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Ashoka University.</p>', '<p>Kanika singh is a Director, Centre for Writing and Communication at Ashoka University, Sonipat, Haryana, India.

The project is expanding to include women writers in the Indian subcontinent. Her current book project, New Kingdoms of Femininity: Medieval and Early Modern Englishwomen’s Utopias, makes the case for the vitality of women’s utopian thought in the pre-modern era. The book argues that these feminotopias deviate from the static representations of place found in canonical male-authored utopias and instead imagine utopian worlds that are constantly mobile and open to change. New Kingdoms shows how that early women reworked the genre of utopia (etymologically “a good place that is nowhere”) to articulate alternative models of female friendship, community and selfhood. </p>', \"<p>Dinesh Jadhav is a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Biology at Ashoka University.

However I continue my research interests in the greater Middle East/ West Asia. I conduct research in a number of languages in including Arabic, Persian and Urdu. I have consistently written for newspapers and magazines in English and Urdu for the past 6 years and have occasionally appeared on television and radio, as I believe that a wider public engagement is of paramount importance in order to try and spread ideas beyond the academy. In particular, I have focused on matters of religious identity, democracy, culture and politics of both South Asia and the Middle East.</p><p>I write under the pen-name Ali Khan Mahmudabad. For the past five years I have also been privileged to be a part of various civil society groups and many of these have focused on the role of religion in democracy, individual and human rights, the rights of minorities, terrorism and security related questions as well as many other issues that have a direct bearing on public policy. In these fora I have had the opportunity and privilege of meeting and working with people from very different backgrounds, including civil society activists, bureaucrats, politicians and journalists, thus enabling me to identify ways in which to seek common ground and facilitate dialogue between people and group interests that otherwise might seem to have disparate interests.</p><p>My PhD at Cambridge focused on the formation of Muslim political identity in North India between 1850-1950. In particular the thesis presented a history of the public space of poetry (the mushā‘irah) and a genealogy of the idea of homeland (watan) over these hundred years. Some of the other subjects relevant to my thesis are ideas of citizenship, patriotism, global Muslim identities and their relevance in the articulation and configuration of Muslim ideas of selfhood. Although I explore these primarily in the context of South Asia, most of these ideas are increasingly relevant in all parts of the Muslim world and a prominent part of debates around political reforms and public policy. Previously, I undertook an MPhil in Historical Studies, also in Cambridge, and wrote a thesis on trans-national Shi‘a Muslim networks in the early 20th century between South Asia and the Middle East.</p><p>Before my Mphil, I studied Arabic at the University of Damascus in Syria. In addition to attending classes at the university, I wrote extensively about Syria for various print and online newspapers and magazines and I travelled widely not only in Syria but also in Lebanon, Egypt and Yemen. Since then I have undertaken research and travelled more extensively in the wider region and have spent substantial time in Iran and Iraq amongst other places. I completed by undergraduate degree from Amherst College (MA, USA) with a double major in History and Political Science.</p>', '<p>Aditi Sriram runs the Undergraduate Writing Program at Ashoka University, whose principal offering is “Introduction to Critical Thinking”.

Rahul completed his DPhil (PhD) in Economics in 2018 from the University of Oxford where he was a Clarendon Scholar. His research interests cover various areas of macroeconomic theory, macro-finance and macroeconomic dynamics in developing countries. Rahul’s current research is concerned with the nexus between macroeconomic policy and finance. In particular he is interested in the transmission mechanism via which monetary policy seeking to stabilise the real economy affects the financial economy. Going the other way, he is also interested in how macroeconomic policy seeking some degree of financial stability (i.e. macro-prudential policy) might affect the real economy, and consequently interact with policy that is simultaneously seeking to stabilise the real economy. In addition to this research agenda, he also has a number of research projects looking at macroeconomic dynamics in developing countries, macroeconomic models with network effects, and labour market dynamics in macroeconomic asset pricing models.</p>', '<p>I have completed my Ph.D. from New York University in May 2019 and I joined as an assistant professor of economics at Ashoka University in Fall, 2019. My primary research interest is to understand and analyze both theoretically and empirically impact of costly learning strategy on the individual decision maker. In my recent paper, I have analyzed the apparent sub-optimal behavior of Indian cotton farmers, whose learning strategy lead to overuse of inputs that reduces the profitability. Based on a theoretical model of learning I have been able to rationalize the learning behavior under a cost of learning constraints and then tested the implications of the learning strategy in a laboratory setting. In another work, I have explored the implication of interaction between private and social learning and used the theoretical framework to analyze the labor market decision of Indian women. My broad research interest involves understanding how constraints in learning affect decision-making behavior and subsequent payoff of decision-makers in a developing economy context. Introducing a learning constraint makes certain behaviors considered sub-optimal under standard neoclassical assumptions rational. Under the assumption of rationality, it becomes possible to make policy analysis that has external validity.</p>', \"<p>Sakshi Satija is a Junior Research Fellow in the Department of Economics at Ashoka University, Sonipat, Haryana, India.
