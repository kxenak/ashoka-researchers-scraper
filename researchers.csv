Among his other interests is to study the parallelism between evolutionary concepts and the cultural history of the world, and integrating the two within the framework of liberal education. He believes that evolutionary biology is a discipline that easily straddles the domains of natural sciences and humanities: it is a subject with historical implications and often has to grapple with the challenge of having to derive logical inferences from natural ‘experiments’ without the luxury of replication in reality, as is the case with history.</p>",https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=55542652600,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/imroze-khan/,imroze.khan@ashoka.edu.in,9,Department of Biology,Assistant Professor ,6

Currently, I am an Assistant Professor at Ashoka University (India). I am preparing for my next step, and hope to be able to work with a smart, mutually respected group of people. Her Research Interests: I specialize in experimental psychology, with an emphasis in social cognition. As a psychologist, I am interested in human interactions in general. To be a bit more specific, my general research interests include—but are not limited to—emotion, morality, belief, social perception, intergroup bias, and double standards. Like the saying goes, research is me-search. Inevitably, throughout my life, I learned that culture is a crucial element that defines who a person is. Since cultures differ greatly, people with different cultural backgrounds may have different cognitions, feelings, and understandings of the same things. Thus, I often investigate the above topics cross-culturally. Throughout my experience, I learned that this process has to be navigated carefully, as it is not simply a matter of comparing two or more cultures and making a claim that there are different narratives. Lastly, as is the nature of psychology, I believe in an interdisciplinary approach to the topics; I investigate things cognitively, neurologically and physiologically. I also use different methods to increase validity and reliability, and I value replications.

These poets, writers, artists and filmmakers, artists who were neither botanists nor environmentalists, she argues, wrote what could be called ‘plant philosophy’. Each of these writers, who were neither botanists nor environmentalists, display a tendency to return to a favoured form of discourse around plant life – Tagore on the garden, Bandyopadhyay on the forest, Das on grass, Chattopadhyay on roots and leaves, and Ray on fantastical plants. This book is an attempt to study their work against the background of the new consciousness about plant life created by scientific research, art, and evolving socio-religious practices of the time. </p>",,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/sumana-roy/,sumana.roy@ashoka.edu.in,1,Department of Creative Writing,Associate Professor,1

Her current book project, New Kingdoms of Femininity: Medieval and Early Modern Englishwomen’s Utopias, makes the case for the vitality of women’s utopian thought in the pre-modern era. The book argues that these feminotopias deviate from the static representations of place found in canonical male-authored utopias and instead imagine utopian worlds that are constantly mobile and open to change. New Kingdoms shows how that early women reworked the genre of utopia (etymologically “a good place that is nowhere”) to articulate alternative models of female friendship, community and selfhood. </p>",https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57191343789,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/alexandra-verini/,alexandra.verini@ashoka.edu.in,1,Department of English,Assistant Professor,1

Deepti’s work engages with museum studies, institutional histories, art reception, consumption studies, urban studies and public culture, to produce critical social histories of art.</p><p>Most recently, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz, as part of the ‘Art Histories and Aesthetic Practices’ programme, and was co-hosted by the Freie University, Berlin (2019-20). As a doctoral candidate, Deepti received the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Bi-Nationally Supervised Ph.D fellowship (2015-16), and was affiliated to the Humboldt University, Berlin. Through the India Foundation for the Arts Museum fellowship (2013, CSMVS), she had the opportunity to conceptualize curatorial schemas for historical collections of the Museum, in Mumbai. Prior to pursuing her research degree, Deepti worked for the Bhau Daji Lad Mumbai City Museum (2009-10), researching institutional history. As an assistant curator at the Devi Art Foundation, Deepti engaged with contemporary art,including on collaborative and process-led exhibitions such as, ‘Where in the World,’ (2008-09); she also conceptualized the early education and outreach programme for the Foundation.</p><p>In October 2021, she was selected as a participant to the Art Schools of Asia project by the Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong. Deepti’s on-going research follows distinct trajectories: drawing pedagogy in the nineteenth century of industrial capitalism and empire, and picnics, as a modern form of leisure, fusing the consumption of ‘nature’ and ‘culture’; she sees these projects as being united by her longstanding interest in marking art’s dispersal into the social sphere.</p>",,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/deepti-mulgund/,deepti.mulgund@ashoka.edu.in,0,Department of Visual Arts,Visiting Faculty,0

Professor Dubey has publications in literary and general interest magazines. She is currently working on a book project (as yet untitled) that examines the cultural life of 19th century orientalist scholarship. It studies the ways in which disciplines like comparative religion and philology not only fed into Victorian esotericism, but were themselves enlivened by some of the same questions as occultists and spiritualists. Looking at a cross-section of novels, poems, translations, occultist texts, and scholarly writings, she will trace the emergence of new forms and formations—literary, cultural, philosophical and historical—from the heterogeneous and discordant encounter of esotericism and orientalism. Her research interests lie in Victorian literature, Nineteenth-Century Literature including Romanticism, empire and colonial discourse analysis, Literary Theory including Affect theory, and Theories of Space.</p>",,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/mandakini-dubey/,mandakini.dubey@ashoka.edu.in,0,Department of English,Assistant Professor ,0

She has taught the Undergraduate Writing Programme’s flagship course — Introduction to Critical Thinking — since 2018. Krittika is trained in History (University of Delhi and University of Oxford) and Religious Studies (University of Edinburgh). Her PhD is in Religious Studies, and her doctoral thesis studied the ways in which tourists to the Scottish island of Iona interacted with its religious reputation. Krittika has taught several courses at institutions in Oxford, Edinburgh and Delhi — on cults, on war, on the Bible in literature — but she enjoys most of all the tricky work of teaching ‘Critical Thinking’.</p><p>In parallel with her continued interest in structured learning and teaching, Krittika works in independent theatre as an actor and writer. She co-runs the Tadpole Repertory Theatre Trust, a New Delhi-based artists’ collective, and takes particular pleasure in ensemble work and short-form comedy (or “sketch”). Krittika’s scholarly interest in ethnography as a means of capturing lively data follows her into the theatrical work she makes. At the same time, her actorly-self bobs behind her, willing itself into classrooms at Ashoka.</p>",,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/krittika-bhattacharjee/,krittika.bhattacharjee@ashoka.edu.in,0,Department of Creative Writing,Assistant Professor,0

In so doing, his work addresses fundamental questions around both the how and why of sleep. Prior to joining Ashoka, Krishna was a Staff Scientist in the Dept of Neuroscience, Washington University School of Medicine studying sleep in the fly Drosophila with Dr. Paul Shaw. He received a PhD from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst studying neural development with Dr. John Nambu.

However I continue my research interests in the greater Middle East/ West Asia. I conduct research in a number of languages in including Arabic, Persian and Urdu. I have consistently written for newspapers and magazines in English and Urdu for the past 6 years and have occasionally appeared on television and radio, as I believe that a wider public engagement is of paramount importance in order to try and spread ideas beyond the academy. In particular, I have focused on matters of religious identity, democracy, culture and politics of both South Asia and the Middle East.</p><p>I write under the pen-name Ali Khan Mahmudabad. For the past five years I have also been privileged to be a part of various civil society groups and many of these have focused on the role of religion in democracy, individual and human rights, the rights of minorities, terrorism and security related questions as well as many other issues that have a direct bearing on public policy. In these fora I have had the opportunity and privilege of meeting and working with people from very different backgrounds, including civil society activists, bureaucrats, politicians and journalists, thus enabling me to identify ways in which to seek common ground and facilitate dialogue between people and group interests that otherwise might seem to have disparate interests.</p><p>My PhD at Cambridge focused on the formation of Muslim political identity in North India between 1850-1950. In particular the thesis presented a history of the public space of poetry (the mushā‘irah) and a genealogy of the idea of homeland (watan) over these hundred years. Some of the other subjects relevant to my thesis are ideas of citizenship, patriotism, global Muslim identities and their relevance in the articulation and configuration of Muslim ideas of selfhood. Although I explore these primarily in the context of South Asia, most of these ideas are increasingly relevant in all parts of the Muslim world and a prominent part of debates around political reforms and public policy. Previously, I undertook an MPhil in Historical Studies, also in Cambridge, and wrote a thesis on trans-national Shi‘a Muslim networks in the early 20th century between South Asia and the Middle East.</p><p>Before my Mphil, I studied Arabic at the University of Damascus in Syria. In addition to attending classes at the university, I wrote extensively about Syria for various print and online newspapers and magazines and I travelled widely not only in Syria but also in Lebanon, Egypt and Yemen. Since then I have undertaken research and travelled more extensively in the wider region and have spent substantial time in Iran and Iraq amongst other places. I completed by undergraduate degree from Amherst College (MA, USA) with a double major in History and Political Science.</p>",,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/m-a-a-khan/,mohammad.khan@ashoka.edu.in,0,Department of Political Science,Assistant Professor,0

Prior to coming to Ashoka, Dr. Youssef held positions as Visiting Assistant Professor of Law, Jurisprudence, and Social Thought at Amherst College, and Lecturer of English at Clemson University. He is writing a book titled The Actuarial Form: Moral Hazard in the Early Novel, which is about the emergence of risk and attendant concepts such as influence, incentive, information, and capacity as figured in the use of mass casualty statistics in literature and political economy. This work is about how risk grew out of a confluence of seventeenth and eighteenth-century genres like the novel, political economy, scientific empiricism, and theology. The project seeks to explain what the law &amp; economics movement can learn from literature. An article from the manuscript has appeared in the journal entitled Law &amp; Literature.

Rahul’s current research is concerned with the nexus between macroeconomic policy and finance. In particular he is interested in the transmission mechanism via which monetary policy seeking to stabilise the real economy affects the financial economy. Going the other way, he is also interested in how macroeconomic policy seeking some degree of financial stability (i.e. macro-prudential policy) might affect the real economy, and consequently interact with policy that is simultaneously seeking to stabilise the real economy. In addition to this research agenda, he also has a number of research projects looking at macroeconomic dynamics in developing countries, macroeconomic models with network effects, and labour market dynamics in macroeconomic asset pricing models.</p>",,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/rahul-nath/,rahul.nath@ashoka.edu.in,0,Department of Economics,Assistant Professor ,0

My primary research interest is to understand and analyze both theoretically and empirically impact of costly learning strategy on the individual decision maker. In my recent paper, I have analyzed the apparent sub-optimal behavior of Indian cotton farmers, whose learning strategy lead to overuse of inputs that reduces the profitability. Based on a theoretical model of learning I have been able to rationalize the learning behavior under a cost of learning constraints and then tested the implications of the learning strategy in a laboratory setting. In another work, I have explored the implication of interaction between private and social learning and used the theoretical framework to analyze the labor market decision of Indian women. My broad research interest involves understanding how constraints in learning affect decision-making behavior and subsequent payoff of decision-makers in a developing economy context. Introducing a learning constraint makes certain behaviors considered sub-optimal under standard neoclassical assumptions rational. Under the assumption of rationality, it becomes possible to make policy analysis that has external validity.</p>",,https://www.ashoka.edu.in/profile/srijita-ghosh/,srijita.ghosh@ashoka.edu.in,0,Department of Economics,Assistant Professor ,0
